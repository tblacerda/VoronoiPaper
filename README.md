# Bridging the Gap: Connecting User Experience and Mobile Network Performance with Voronoi Tessellation

This repository contains the code and the paper for the research project "Bridging the Gap: Connecting User Experience and Mobile Network Performance with Voronoi Tessellation".

## Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel method to measure and visualize the user experience (UX) of mobile applications in relation to the network performance. We use Voronoi tessellation to partition the geographical area into cells based on the network signal strength and the number of users. We then collect and analyze various UX metrics, such as loading time, responsiveness, and satisfaction, from the users within each cell. We also develop an interactive web-based dashboard to display the UX and network performance data on a map, using different colors and shapes to represent the Voronoi cells. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset from a popular mobile game, and show that it can effectively reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of UX and network performance, as well as the correlations and trade-offs between them. Our method can help mobile developers, network operators, and regulators to monitor and improve the UX of mobile applications.

- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- dash

You can install them using pip:
